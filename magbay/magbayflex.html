            <p>It can never be denied that coffee is most popular drink in the morning for most people, however, it is hard to disregard the fact that a lot of people are having a change of heart of their coffee to teas not only for their caffeine intake but also for health considerations.</p>

            <p>I started with the brand, which is one of the famous makers of tea, – TWININGS. I would drink my tea in the morning, in the afternoon and before sleeping. The taste of TWININGS – Mint green tea was not that strong; it was so smooth in the throat and the smell was so calming.
                Then I tried different kinds of brands of green tea with mint/peppermint. Each brand has different taste but the mint/peppermint on it still lets me want more each day.

            <p>Then I went for the Organic Mint Green teas and the loose – leaf mint green teas. The taste differs from the green teas in tea bags as the loose – leaf mint green teas are much stronger in taste and I even fell in love more with mint green teas. I was consequently into it and I was having more or less four cups a day with the loose – leaf mint green teas.</p>

        <div>
            <p>Getting more acquainted with mint/peppermint green teas had me craved to try other flavors or should I say green teas with “infusion” and I really wish that everyone would also try and enjoy different flavors.</p>
